# Another Multi User Dungeon

> First an apology: I don't really know what a Multi User Dungeon is supposed to look like. I haven't played in any before. I know they exist, and when doing other programming work, I thought about what it would be like to program a system where users would sign in to a virtual realm and manipulate the objects in it. So I set out to give it a try. I'm not that strong with graphics, so it's kept really basic for now, operating on labels mostly, and when searching to name the thing, I just though it might fit the broad definition of a Multi-User Dungeon. Hope you like it.

AMUD is a multi-user environment where persons dwell between connected rooms and streets and manipulate the things present therein. User entry is sent to all persons present in the current room. Last user entry is used by some operations on things (e.g.: how much money to give).

It's a proof-of-concept of an application based on WebSocket's based on xxm.
