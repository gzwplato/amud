<h3>Welcome to 'Another Multi User Dungeon'</h3>
<p><i>First an apology: I don't really know what a Multi User Dungeon is supposed to look like. I haven't played in any before. I know they exist, and when doing other programming work, I thought about what it would be like to program a system where users would sign in to a virtual realm and manipulate the objects in it. So I set out to give it a try. I'm not that strong with graphics, so it's kept really basic for now, operating on labels mostly, and when searching to name the thing, I just though it might fit the broad definition of a Multi-User Dungeon. Hope you like it.</i></p>
<p>The view shows:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="border-bottom:1px solid green;">your inventory, which is empty at the start</li>
  <li style="border-bottom:1px solid red;">the room's name</li>
  <li style="border-bottom:1px solid blue;">what's in the room</li>
  <li style="border-bottom:1px solid gold;">who's in the room</li>
</ul>
<p>You have an entry bar, type and press <i>Enter</i> to speak into the room.</p>
<p>Click a thing (in your inventory or in the room) to display which actions are available with it. For example, go through a door to another room.</p>
<p>Click the thing again to select it for extra actions such as combining or giving it to someone. //TODO:</p>
<h3>Where to go</h3>
